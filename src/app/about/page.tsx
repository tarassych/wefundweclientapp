          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            WeFundWe leverages blockchain smart contracts to ensure complete transparency and automatic fund distribution. Here's how it works:

            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> All donations are held in blockchain smart contracts that automatically execute when campaign conditions are met.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing complete visibility into fund flow and usage.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Security:</strong> Funds cannot be accessed or modified without meeting the predefined conditions in the smart contract.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Automation:</strong> Payouts are triggered automatically when campaign goals are achieved, eliminating manual intervention and potential delays.
