```

### Setting up Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API
4. Go to "Credentials" and create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID
5. Add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` to the authorized redirect URIs
6. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local` file

### Setting up MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account at [https://www.mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster (free tier is sufficient for development)
3. Set up database access with a username and password
4. Set up network access (allow access from anywhere for development: 0.0.0.0/0)
5. Get your connection string from the "Connect" button
6. Replace `<password>` with your actual password in the connection string
7. Add the connection string to your `.env.local` file as `MONGODB_URI`

### Setting up Alchemy Blockchain Integration

1. Create an Alchemy account at [https://www.alchemy.com/](https://www.alchemy.com/)
2. Create a new app in the Alchemy dashboard
3. Select Ethereum as the blockchain and Mainnet as the network
4. Copy your API key from the app dashboard
5. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file as `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`

### Setting up Smart Contract

1. Deploy your multi-campaign smart contract to Ethereum mainnet
2. Copy the contract address and add it to your `.env.local` file as `CAMPAIGN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
3. Create a deployer wallet or use an existing one
4. Add the wallet's private key to your `.env.local` file as `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`
5. Add the wallet's address to your `.env.local` file as `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS`

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control
- Use a dedicated wallet for deployment with limited funds
- Consider using environment-specific keys for development vs production

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

2. When accessing protected pages, users are redirected to sign-in
3. After successful Google authentication, users are redirected to the dashboard
4. The navigation bar shows different options based on authentication status

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses MUI's theming system. You can customize the theme in `src/components/ThemeRegistry.tsx`:

```typescript
const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: "#1976d2", // Your primary color
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#dc004e", // Your secondary color
    },
  },
});
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new directory in `src/app/` for your page
2. Add a `page.tsx` file with your component
3. Import and use the `Navigation` component for consistent layout

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Other Platforms
The application can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- Railway
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS Amplify
